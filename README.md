Shopkeep: The Game

You, the player, are the humble shopkeeper in a lowly town. You venture into the local dungeon to procure goods to sell in your shop, with the ultimate prize, "Shopkeeper of the Year," as your goal. 

Phase 1:
You go into the local dungeon to seek our new treasure. When faced with conflict with local enemies, you're given the option to run away, or pay them off for the goods they're guarding in their treasure chests.

Phase 2:
You're tending your shop! Local patrons will visit and make an offer to you on goods that you're selling. Most will try to undercut your pricing, and haggle with you, but if you're going to reach your goal of Shopkeeper of the Year you've got to keep your profit margin in mind. After selling through your goods, back to the dungeon you go.
