Shopkeep: The Game
A text-based adventure.

You, the player, are the humble shopkeeper in a lowly town. You venture into the local dungeon to procure goods to sell in your shop, with the ultimate prize, "Shopkeeper of the Year," as your goal. 

Phase 1:
You sell through your available wares to local townspeople, before ultimately traveling to the local dungeon to procure more goods.


Phase 2:
Venturing into the local dungeon can be dangerous, but some monsters have caught wind that you'll pay good money for goods. They offer to sell you things rather than attacking you on sight, allowing you to replenish your goods with little effort. Get goods and then head back into town to capitalize on your gained goods!
